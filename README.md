Foodini is a simple way for one to map out their pantry through the useage of groundbreaking image recognition techonology by Clarifai. It allows one to take pictures of food items and generate a recipe using all, if not, most, of the provided items, to bring a new meal to the plate every time. Find more things I've made at:
